# Screen OCR LLM - Project Status

## Current Mission
Fix the mouse click-drag functionality that currently starts but does not properly trigger OCR processing when the mouse button is released.

### Root Cause
The region selection callback mechanism has a critical flaw: `gui.SetRegionSelectionCallback()` is called twice, causing the OCR processing callback (set in `main/main.go`) to be overwritten by the synchronous adapter callback (set in `overlay/overlay_windows.go`). This prevents the OCR workflow from executing after region selection completes.

**Evidence from logs:**
- Region selection completes successfully: "Region selected: {X:0 Y:0 Width:904 Height:323}"
- Window is destroyed: "Selection completed: {X:0 Y:0 Width:904 Height:323}"
- **Missing**: "Processing region" log that should come from the OCR callback
- Conclusion: The callback is never invoked because it was overwritten

### Solution Approach
Refactor the callback mechanism to eliminate the overwriting issue:
1. Modify `gui.StartRegionSelection()` to return `(screenshot.Region, error)` instead of using a callback
2. Remove the callback mechanism entirely from `gui/gui.go`
3. Update `overlay/overlay_windows.go` to use the direct return value
4. Move OCR processing logic to the eventloop, after `Select()` returns

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify
1. `gui/gui.go` - Remove callback mechanism, change return type
2. `overlay/overlay_windows.go` - Use direct return value instead of callback
3. `eventloop/eventloop.go` - Add OCR processing after `Select()` returns
4. `main/main.go` - Remove callback setup

### Code Signature Changes
- `gui.StartRegionSelection()`: `error` → `(screenshot.Region, error)`
- `gui.SetRegionSelectionCallback()`: **REMOVED**
- `gui.RegionSelectionCallback`: **REMOVED**
- `gui.regionCallback` variable: **REMOVED**

### Architecture Flow (After Fix)
```
Hotkey pressed
  → eventloop.handleHotkey()
    → overlay.windowsSelector.Select()
      → gui.StartRegionSelection()
        → StartInteractiveRegionSelection() [blocks until selection]
        → Returns region
      ← Returns region
    ← Returns region
    → eventloop processes OCR on returned region
```

## PROVIDERS Configuration Fix (2025-10-01)

### Issue
User reported: "PROVIDERS= setting is ignored"

### Investigation
- ✅ Production code (main/main.go, main_new.go) already passes Providers correctly
- ❌ All test files were missing Providers field
- ❌ No logging to verify Providers usage

### Fixes Applied
1. **Added comprehensive logging** to llm/llm.go:
   - Init() logs configured providers
   - getProviderPreferences() logs what's returned
   - makeAPIRequest() logs provider preferences in request

2. **Fixed all test files** to pass Providers:
   - test_ocr_with_image.go
   - debug_test.go (2 locations)
   - validation_test.go
   - integration_test.go
   - ocr/ocr_test.go (2 locations)
   - hotkey/hotkey_test.go
   - llm/llm_test.go (3 locations)

### Verification
✅ Test run confirms PROVIDERS is working:
```
Configuration loaded:
  Model: google/gemma-3-12b-it
  Providers: [crusoe/bf16 novita/bf16 deepinfra/bf16]

LLM: Initialized with 3 provider(s): [crusoe/bf16 novita/bf16 deepinfra/bf16]
LLM: Using provider preferences: order=[crusoe/bf16 novita/bf16 deepinfra/bf16], allow_fallbacks=false
LLM: API request includes provider preferences: &{Order:[crusoe/bf16 novita/bf16 deepinfra/bf16] ...}
```

### Conclusion
**PROVIDERS was NOT being ignored in production code.** The issue was:
1. Test files weren't passing it (now fixed)
2. No logging to verify it (now added)

See PROVIDERS_FIX_SUMMARY.md for complete details.

## Python Insights Implementation Review (2025-10-01)

### Analysis Completed
Reviewed PYTHON_ANALYSIS_INSIGHTS.md and verified implementation status.

### Implementation Status

**✅ Fully Implemented:**
1. **Win+ Key Support** - All three aliases (win, cmd, super) map to VK_LWIN/VK_RWIN
2. **Multi-Monitor Support** - Uses virtual screen metrics (SM_XVIRTUALSCREEN, SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN)
3. **Screenshot DPI Handling** - Library handles DPI internally (similar to Python's mss)

**❌ Not Implemented:**
1. **Modifier Key Release** - No explicit release of Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Win after hotkey
2. **DPI Awareness Declaration** - No manifest or SetProcessDPIAware() call
3. **Per-Monitor DPI Queries** - No GetDpiForMonitor() for different DPI scales

### Recommendations

**High Priority:**
- Add DPI awareness declaration (manifest or SetProcessDPIAware())
- Impact: MEDIUM - Prevents DPI virtualization issues on high-DPI displays

**Medium Priority:**
- Implement modifier key release after hotkey activation
- Impact: LOW - Prevents rare stuck key issues

**Low Priority:**
- Add per-monitor DPI queries for advanced multi-monitor setups
- Impact: LOW - Only needed for different DPI scales per monitor

See PYTHON_INSIGHTS_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for complete analysis and implementation details.

## OCR Empty Result Investigation (2025-10-01)

### Issue
User reported OCR returned empty result after selecting screen rectangle.

### Log Analysis
- ✅ Hotkey detected correctly
- ✅ Region selected: 1107x226 pixels
- ✅ Screenshot captured
- ✅ Provider preferences used
- ✅ API request sent
- ❌ **NO API RESPONSE LOGGING** - Gap between request and popup

### Root Cause
Insufficient logging in OCR pipeline. API call completed but couldn't diagnose what happened:
- Did API return error?
- Did API return empty text?
- Was there network error?
- Did retry logic kick in?

### Fix Applied
Added comprehensive logging to `llm/llm.go`:
1. API request failure logging (with attempt number)
2. Empty response logging
3. Text extraction logging (character count)
4. Success logging
5. Final failure logging
6. HTTP response status logging
7. API error logging
8. Response parsing success logging

### Expected Behavior
With new logging, will see one of:
- **Success**: "API returned text: N characters" → "Successfully extracted N characters"
- **Empty**: "API returned text: 0 characters" → "No text detected in image"
- **API Error**: "API error response: ..." with details
- **Network Error**: "API request failed: ..." with connection details

### Next Steps
1. Rebuild: `go build -o screen-ocr-llm.exe ./main` ✅
2. Run resident and test again
3. Check logs for detailed diagnostics
4. Identify actual cause of empty result

See OCR_EMPTY_RESULT_INVESTIGATION.md for complete analysis.

## OCR Success Verification (2025-10-01)

### Retest Results
User retested with new logging. **OCR WORKED PERFECTLY!**

### Log Analysis
- ✅ Line 309: `API response status: 200 200 OK`
- ✅ Line 310: `API response parsed successfully, 1 choices`
- ✅ Line 311: `API returned text: 265 characters` **SUCCESS!**
- ✅ Line 312: `Successfully extracted 265 characters` **SUCCESS!**
- ❌ Line 313: `event loop stopped: context canceled` (User pressed Ctrl+C)

### Conclusion
**OCR did NOT return empty!** It successfully extracted 265 characters.

**Issue**: User pressed Ctrl+C before seeing the result:
- Popup was created (lines 299-308)
- Text was likely copied to clipboard
- User terminated program before popup could display

**Solution**:
1. Check clipboard - the 265 characters should be there
2. Wait for popup to appear (3 seconds) before terminating
3. Don't press Ctrl+C immediately after selection

### Verification
- ✅ API calls work perfectly
- ✅ Provider preferences used correctly
- ✅ Text extraction successful
- ✅ Logging shows complete pipeline
- ✅ OCR pipeline is fully functional

See OCR_SUCCESS_ANALYSIS.md for complete analysis.

## PostQuitMessage Bug Fix (2025-10-01)

### Issue
Second hotkey activation failed with "selection cancelled" error.

### Root Cause
Popup's `WM_DESTROY` handler called `PostQuitMessage(0)` which posted `WM_QUIT` to the thread's message queue. This `WM_QUIT` was received by the region selector window, causing it to exit immediately.

### Fix
Replaced `PostQuitMessage` with custom `WM_EXIT_LOOP` message. The popup message loop now exits on this custom message instead of `WM_QUIT`, preventing interference with other windows.

### Files Modified
- `notification/notification_windows.go`:
  - Added `WM_EXIT_LOOP` constant
  - Changed `WM_DESTROY` to post `WM_EXIT_LOOP` instead of calling `PostQuitMessage`
  - Modified message loop to exit on `WM_EXIT_LOOP`

---

## Popup Styling Improvements (2025-10-01)

### Changes
1. **Border**: Added `WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE` for 3D sunken border
2. **Text Alignment**: Changed from centered to left-aligned, top-aligned
3. **Logging**: Added logging for existing popup closure

### Files Modified
- `notification/notification_windows.go`:
  - Added `WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE` constant
  - Changed window style to include `WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE`
  - Removed `WS_BORDER` (replaced by `WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE`)
  - Changed `DrawText` flags from `DT_CENTER|DT_VCENTER|DT_WORDBREAK` to `DT_WORDBREAK`
  - Added logging in `StartCountdownPopup` for existing popup closure

---

## Thread Isolation Fix (2025-10-01)

### Issue
Second hotkey activation still failed with "selection cancelled" even after PostQuitMessage fix and message queue flushing.

### Root Cause
The main goroutine was NOT locked to an OS thread. Go's scheduler could reuse the popup thread for the region selector, causing the region selector to inherit the popup thread's message queue state.

### Fix
1. Added `runtime.LockOSThread()` at the start of `main()` to lock the main goroutine to its own dedicated OS thread
2. This ensures the region selector always runs on a different thread than the popup
3. Message queue isolation is now guaranteed

### Files Modified
- `main/main.go`: Added `runtime.LockOSThread()` call and `runtime` import

### Testing
Created `test_popup_flow.go` to test multiple consecutive popup operations:
- Test 1: First OCR with countdown ✓
- Test 2: Second OCR (where bug occurred) ✓
- Test 3: Third OCR ✓
- All tests passed, message queue properly flushed (0x402 = WM_EXIT_LOOP)

## Standalone (--run-once no resident) Countdown + IPC Port Fix (2025-10-01)

### Changes
1) Standalone countdown:
- runOCROnce now starts a countdown popup using the same OCR deadline as the resident
- On success, popup updates to the result (3s) just like the resident flow
- On errors (OCR/clipboard), countdown is closed gracefully

2) Delegation/IPC port fix:
- .env is loaded before delegation attempt so SINGLEINSTANCE_PORT_*/OCR_DEADLINE_SEC are applied
- Ensures the client scans the correct TCP port range and delegates to the resident

3) Architectural reduction of duplication:
- Exported ReadDeadline() from eventloop and reused it in runOCROnce
- Aligns timeout logic across resident and standalone flows

### Files Modified
- eventloop/eventloop.go (ReadDeadline exported, internal calls updated)
- main/main.go (load .env before delegation; start countdown + update result in runOCROnce)

### Outcome
- Standalone mode now shows a ticking countdown and result
- Delegated --run-once finds resident reliably when ports are configured in .env
- Deadline logic shared to minimize duplication

---

## Delegated --run-once Countdown Reliability (2025-10-01)

### Issue
Popup appeared during delegated --run-once, but countdown did not tick. Cause: the countdown timer was started by a delayed external goroutine and could race with popup creation, occasionally missing the hwnd.

### Fix
- Start TIMER_COUNTDOWN inside createAndShowPopup() whenever countdown mode is active (reliable immediate start)
- External delayed timer remains harmless (restarts same timer if it runs), but the immediate start guarantees ticking

### Files Modified
- notification/notification_windows.go: In countdown mode, call SetTimer(TIMER_COUNTDOWN, 1000) right after window creation

### Outcome
- Delegated --run-once now shows a ticking countdown consistently, matching the hotkey path UX.

---

## Delegated --run-once Popup Countdown (2025-10-01)

### Change
When a --run-once invocation delegates to an active resident, the resident now starts the countdown popup immediately (mirroring the hotkey path) and then updates it with OCR results.

### Files Modified
- eventloop/eventloop.go
  - In handleConn(), after computing deadline, call popup.StartCountdown(int(deadline.Seconds()))
  - Close the popup if submission is rejected due to busy state

### Outcome
- Users invoking --run-once with an active resident now see the same visual feedback as hotkey activations: a countdown that transitions to the result popup.

---

## Region Selector WM_QUIT Residue Fix (2025-10-01)

### Issue
Second hotkey activation failed immediately with "selection cancelled". Logs showed the region selector message loop received WM_QUIT right after window creation during the second activation.

### Root Cause
On successful selection, our code destroys the window and returns immediately from StartInteractiveRegionSelection(). The overlay wndproc's WM_DESTROY handler was calling PostQuitMessage(0), which enqueued a WM_QUIT to the main thread's message queue. Because we returned before the loop consumed it, that WM_QUIT remained pending and was consumed at the start of the next selection, causing an immediate cancel.

### Fix
- Removed PostQuitMessage from WM_DESTROY in gui/region_selector_windows.go
- This prevents leaving a stray WM_QUIT in the thread queue after successful selections

### Outcome
- Second and subsequent hotkey activations no longer see an immediate WM_QUIT
- Selection proceeds normally across consecutive activations

---

## Consecutive Hotkey Presses Stability Fix (2025-10-01)

### Issue
In some cases, rapid consecutive hotkey activations could leave the popup message loop prematurely, risking stale window state and interfering with the next activation (especially when OCR timeout/countdown exceeded 5 seconds).

### Fix
- Removed the hard-coded 5-second cap in the popup's message loop
- The loop now runs until WM_QUIT or the custom WM_EXIT_LOOP is received
- This ensures the countdown and result-display timers are always processed to completion and the message queue is cleanly flushed afterward

### Files Modified
- notification/notification_windows.go
  - Replaced time-bound message loop with an unconditional loop that exits on WM_QUIT or WM_EXIT_LOOP

### Outcome
- Improved robustness for back-to-back hotkey activations
- Eliminates premature loop exit during longer countdowns (e.g., 10s OCR deadline)
- Works in concert with prior fixes (WM_EXIT_LOOP + LockOSThread) to ensure stable consecutive runs
